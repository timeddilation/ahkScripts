These are scripts that I either made or stole and made better for my own use. 
The majority of scripts are used for games, and others are just my personal preference for desktop shortcuts.

Mostly, I just want to track my own scripts and changes I make. 
So, this is mainly a personal repo, but if I every want someone to take a look, or make changes, this is a nice and easy place to do it.

To use these scripts, you must have [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/download/) installed.

The "HotKeys.ahk" file is my default script I run on my dekstop.
